You can create an Nginx pod in Kubernetes by defining a Pod manifest file and applying it using `kubectl` command. Here is an example of a simple Nginx Pod manifest file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Save the above content in a file named `nginx-pod.yaml` and apply it using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
```

This will create an Nginx Pod with the name `nginx-pod` running the latest Nginx image on port 80.

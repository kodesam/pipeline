Sure, here is a simple shell script that will use curl to send a request to `192.168.10.10` 10 times:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}
do
  curl -sS "http://192.168.10.10"
done
```

Save this script in a file (e.g., `curl_script.sh`), make it executable using `chmod +x curl_script.sh`, and then run it using `./curl_script.sh`. This will send a request to `192.168.10.10` 10 times.

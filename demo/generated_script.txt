To create an Nginx pod in Kubernetes, you can use the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

You can save this YAML manifest to a file (e.g., nginx-pod.yaml) and then create the pod using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
```

This will create a pod named "nginx-pod" running an Nginx container using the latest Nginx image. The container is configured to listen on port 80.

It looks like you have combined multiple Ansible playbooks into a single playbook with separate tasks for each operation involving the Elasticsearch pod in the `openshift-logging` namespace. This structure can be useful to perform a sequence of actions related to the Elasticsearch pod.

You can save the content you provided as a YAML file (let's say `elasticsearch_operations.yaml`) and then run it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook elasticsearch_operations.yaml
```

This playbook will execute each task defined in the file sequentially. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and configurations set up to run these commands in your Ansible environment.

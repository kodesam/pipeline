To send a cURL request to Yahoo! 10 times using a Bash script, you can use a `for` loop in the script. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Sending request $i"
  curl https://www.yahoo.com
done
```

Save the script to a file, e.g., `yahoo_curl.sh`. Then, make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x yahoo_curl.sh
```

To execute the script and send the cURL request to Yahoo! 10 times, use the following command:

```bash
./yahoo_curl.sh
```

This will send the cURL request and display the output for each request in the terminal. Adjust the script or cURL parameters as needed for your specific use case.

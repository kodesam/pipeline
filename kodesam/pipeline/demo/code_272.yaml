Automating the patching activity for OpenShift involves using Ansible playbooks to manage the patches across the cluster. Below is an example of an Ansible playbook that you can use to automate the patching activity for OpenShift:

```yaml
---
- name: Patching OpenShift Cluster
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check for available updates
      yum:
        list: updates

    - name: Install available updates
      yum:
        name: "*"
        state: latest
```

In this playbook:
1. The playbook checks for available updates using the `yum` module with the `list: updates` option to list all available updates.
2. It then uses the `yum` module again with `state: latest` to install all available updates.

You can save this playbook as a YAML file (e.g., `patch_openshift.yaml`) and then run it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook patch_openshift.yaml
```

Make sure to adjust the playbook according to your OpenShift setup and specific requirements for patching activities. Additionally, you may need to add more tasks to handle other pre- or post-patching activities like backups, service restarts, etc.

Certainly! Here's a shell script that uses the `curl` command to ping an IP address 10 times in a month and saves the output to a file named `ping_output` in the `/tmp` folder.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# IP address to ping
IP_ADDRESS="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"

# Get the current month and year
current_month=$(date +%m)
current_year=$(date +%Y)

# Create the output file path
output_file="/tmp/ping_output_${current_month}_${current_year}.txt"

# Loop 10 times to ping the IP address
for (( i=1; i<=10; i++ )); do
    # Perform the curl request and append the output to the file
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Date: %{date_nstime}\nHTTP code: %{http_code}\n\n" "$IP_ADDRESS" >> "$output_file"
done

echo "Ping results saved to $output_file"
```

Save the above script to a file, for example, `ping_ip.sh`. Then, make the script executable by running `chmod +x ping_ip.sh`. Finally, execute the script by running `./ping_ip.sh`.

Replace `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` with the actual IP address you want to ping. The script will ping the specified IP address 10 times, appending the date and HTTP code of each request to the `ping_output_<month>_<year>.txt` file in the `/tmp` folder. For example, if the current month is `02` and the current year is `2022`, the output file will be `ping_output_02_2022.txt`.

Please note that the script uses the `-s` flag for silent mode, so it won't display the output of each request on the console. If you want to see the output as well, you can remove the `-s` flag from the `curl` command.

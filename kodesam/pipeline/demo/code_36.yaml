I apologize for any confusion caused. As an AI language model, my responses are based on general knowledge up until September 2021. I do not have access to current or future events.

To find out when the next F1 race in 2024 will take place, I recommend checking the official Formula 1 website or referring to reliable sources such as sports news websites, F1 social media channels, or the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) website for the most up-to-date and accurate race schedules. These sources will provide the most reliable and current information regarding future F1 races.

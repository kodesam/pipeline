To automate the monitoring of the patching activity of OpenShift using Ansible, you can create a playbook that periodically checks for updates and notifies you about the patching status. Here is an example of an Ansible playbook to achieve this:

```yaml
---
- name: Watch Patching Activity of OpenShift
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Check for available updates
      command: yum check-update
      register: update_check

    - name: Send email notification if updates are available
      when: update_check.stdout != ""
      mail:
        to: your@email.com
        subject: "OpenShift Patching Update Watch"
        body: "Updates are available for OpenShift. Please check and apply as needed."
      delegate_to: localhost
```

In this playbook:
1. The playbook runs the `yum check-update` command to check for available updates on the OpenShift system.
2. If updates are available, it sends an email notification to the specified email address using the `mail` module.

You can save this playbook as a YAML file (e.g., `watch_patching.yaml`) and schedule this playbook to run at regular intervals using cron or any other scheduler. This way, you can automate the monitoring of patching activity in your OpenShift environment.

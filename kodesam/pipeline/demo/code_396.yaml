I apologize, but as an AI language model, I don't have real-time data or the ability to browse the internet. The Formula 1 (F1) race schedule for 2024 has not been released yet. The F1 race calendar is typically announced by the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) and Formula 1 management closer to the end of the previous year or at the beginning of the current year.

To find the exact date of the next F1 race in 2024, I recommend checking official Formula 1 websites, news sources, or the FIA website for the most up-to-date and accurate information on the race schedule.

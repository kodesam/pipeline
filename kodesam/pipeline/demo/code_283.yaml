Here is an example of a jinja2 template for an Ansible playbook that uses the `curl` command to fetch data from the Yahoo website:

```yaml
---
- name: Fetch data from Yahoo
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Fetch data using curl
      command: curl https://www.yahoo.com
      register: curl_output

    - name: Display curl output
      debug:
        var: curl_output.stdout_lines
```

You can save this template in a file with a `.yaml` or `.yml` extension, and then use Ansible to execute it. Make sure you have Ansible installed on your system before running the playbook.

To execute the playbook, run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml
```

Replace `playbook.yaml` with the actual name of your playbook file.

This playbook will run the `curl` command to fetch the Yahoo homepage and store the output in the `curl_output` variable. The playbook then displays the output using the `debug` module. You can modify the playbook as needed to suit your requirements.

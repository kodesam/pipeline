Here is a shell script that uses the curl command to send a GET request to a specified IP address 200 times:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the IP address
IP_ADDRESS="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"

# Loop 200 times
for i in {1..200}; do
    # Send a GET request to the IP address using curl
    curl "$IP_ADDRESS"
done
```

Please replace `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` with the actual IP address you want to send the request to. Save the script with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `script.sh`) and execute it in a terminal to run the script.

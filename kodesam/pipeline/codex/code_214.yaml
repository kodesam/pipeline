Here is a shell script that will execute the `curl` command to fetch data from the Yahoo homepage 10 times:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

URL="https://www.yahoo.com"

for ((i=1; i<=10; i++)); do
    curl "$URL"
done
```

Save the script to a file (e.g., `curl_script.sh`) and make it executable by running `chmod +x curl_script.sh` in the terminal. 
Then you can run the script by executing `./curl_script.sh` in the terminal. It will perform the `curl` command to fetch data from the Yahoo homepage 10 times.

Certainly! Here's a simple shell script that will execute the `curl` command to fetch `vodafonez` 10 times:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for ((i=1; i<=10; i++))
do
    curl "vodafonez"
    echo "Request $i completed"
done
```

Save the above script in a file (e.g., `run_curl.sh`), make it executable by running `chmod +x run_curl.sh`, and then execute it with `./run_curl.sh`. This will run the `curl` command 10 times, displaying the completion status of each request.

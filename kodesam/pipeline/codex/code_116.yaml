Certainly! Here's an example Ansible script that uses the `docker_image` module to manage Docker images and creates a GitOps image:


---
- name: Create GitOps Docker Image
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  
  tasks:
    - name: Install Docker SDK for Python
      pip:
        name: docker
        state: present

    - name: Create GitOps Docker Image
      docker_image:
        name: your-registry/gitops-app
        tag: latest
        build:
          path: /path/to/gitops-app
          dockerfile: /path/to/gitops-app/Dockerfile
        state: present


Make sure to replace `/path/to/gitops-app` with the actual path to your GitOps application code, and `/path/to/gitops-app/Dockerfile` with the path to your Dockerfile for building the image.

You can run this playbook with the command `ansible-playbook create_gitops_image.yml`, assuming you have Ansible installed and configured properly.

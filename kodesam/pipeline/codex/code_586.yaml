Certainly! Here's a simple shell script that uses the `curl` command to request the Yahoo homepage 10 times:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}
do
    echo "Request $i"
    curl -s https://www.yahoo.com
done
```

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., `yahoo_curl.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x yahoo_curl.sh`), and run it:

```shell
$ ./yahoo_curl.sh
```

The script will send a GET request to the Yahoo homepage using `curl` and display the output. It will repeat this process 10 times, with each request labeled as "Request X" (where X is the iteration number).

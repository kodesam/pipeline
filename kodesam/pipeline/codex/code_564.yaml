#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}
do
    curl -s http://yahoo.com
done

Save the script in a file, for example, `script.sh`, and then run it using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

This script will execute the `curl` command to retrieve the Yahoo homepage 10 times. The `-s` flag is used to prevent `curl` from showing progress output.

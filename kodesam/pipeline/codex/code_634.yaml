Here's a shell script that uses the `curl` command to send a request to a specific IP address 10 times:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

IP_ADDRESS="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"

for ((i=1; i<=10; i++))
do
    echo "Request $i:"
    curl $IP_ADDRESS
    echo ""
done
```

Make sure to replace `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` with the actual IP address you want to send the request to. 

Save the script in a file, e.g., `curl_ip.sh`, and make it executable using the command `chmod +x curl_ip.sh`. Then, you can run the script by executing `./curl_ip.sh` in the terminal.

You can use a shell script to repeat a curl command 10 times. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for ((i=1; i<=10; i++))
do
    curl -s https://www.example.com > output$i.html
    echo "Curl $i completed"
done
```

This script will execute the curl command 10 times and save the output in separate files, with the filename having a numerical suffix. Modify the curl command and the filename format according to your needs.

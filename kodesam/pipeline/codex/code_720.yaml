Here is a shell script that will execute the `curl` command with a specified IP address 10 times:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

IP_ADDRESS="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"

for ((i=1; i<=10; i++)); do
    curl "$IP_ADDRESS"
done
```

Make sure to replace `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` with the actual IP address you want to use. 
Save the script to a file (e.g., `curl_script.sh`) and make it executable by running `chmod +x curl_script.sh` in the terminal. 
Then you can run the script by executing `./curl_script.sh` in the terminal. It will perform the `curl` command with the specified IP address 10 times.

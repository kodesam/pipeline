To play an Openheimer movie using an Ansible playbook, you can use the following YAML playbook example:

```yaml
---
- name: Play Openheimer Movie
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Download Openheimer Movie
      command: >
        wget http://example.com/openheimer_movie.mp4
        creates=/path/to/openheimer_movie.mp4

    - name: Play Openheimer Movie
      command: >
        vlc /path/to/openheimer_movie.mp4
```

In this playbook example, the movie is being downloaded using the `wget` command from a given URL, and the `creates` parameter ensures that the download is skipped if the movie file already exists in the specified path.

After the movie is downloaded, the `vlc` command is used to play the movie using the VLC media player. Ensure that VLC is installed on the system where the playbook is being executed.

You can save this playbook in a YAML file, for example, `play_openheimer_movie.yaml`, and then execute it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```shell
ansible-playbook play_openheimer_movie.yaml
```

Make sure to replace the URL for the movie and the path to the movie file with the actual values for your scenario

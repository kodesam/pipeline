To test a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 for the control plane and user plane in a 4G network using Ansible, you can use the following playbook YAML example as a starting point:

```yaml
---
- name: Test Mix of IPv4 and IPv6 in 4G Network
  hosts: 4g_devices
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Test Control Plane IPv4 Connectivity
      ping:
        dest: control_plane_ipv4_address
        count: 3
      register: control_plane_ipv4_ping_output

    - name: Test Control Plane IPv6 Connectivity
      ping6:
        dest: control_plane_ipv6_address
        count: 3
      register: control_plane_ipv6_ping_output

    - name: Test User Plane IPv4 Connectivity
      ping:
        dest: user_plane_ipv4_address
        count: 3
      register: user_plane_ipv4_ping_output

    - name: Test User Plane IPv6 Connectivity
      ping6:
        dest: user_plane_ipv6_address
        count: 3
      register: user_plane_ipv6_ping_output

    - name: Display Test Results
      debug:
        msg: |
          Control Plane IPv4 Ping Results:
          {{ control_plane_ipv4_ping_output.stdout }}
          
          Control Plane IPv6 Ping Results:
          {{ control_plane_ipv6_ping_output.stdout }}
          
          User Plane IPv4 Ping Results:
          {{ user_plane_ipv4_ping_output.stdout }}
          
          User Plane IPv6 Ping Results:
          {{ user_plane_ipv6_ping_output.stdout }}
```

In this playbook example, we assume that you have a group of 4G devices specified in your inventory under the name `4g_devices`. Adjust this group name according to your inventory configuration.

The playbook uses the `ping` and `ping6` modules to test connectivity to the control plane and user plane addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6. Adjust the `dest` parameter with the appropriate IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for your network.

The `count` parameter in each ping task specifies the number of ICMP echo request packets to be sent.

The playbook captures the output of each ping task into separate variables, such as `control_plane_ipv4_ping_output`, `control_plane_ipv6_ping_output`, `user_plane_ipv4_ping_output`, and `user_plane_ipv6_ping_output`.

Finally, the playbook uses the `debug` module to display the ping results for each plane and address type.

You can save this playbook in a YAML file, such as `test_ipv4_ipv6_connectivity.yaml`, and execute it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```shell
ansible-playbook test_ipv4_ipv6_connectivity.yaml
```

Make sure to adjust the playbook parameters, such as the group name in the inventory and the control plane/user plane IPv4/IPv6 addresses, according to your specific 4G network configuration.

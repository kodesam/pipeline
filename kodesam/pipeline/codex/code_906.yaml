To write a test case script to check the SDWAN router interface status using Ansible, you can use the following YAML playbook example as a starting point:

```yaml
---
- name: Check SDWAN Router Interface Status Test
  hosts: sdwan_devices
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Get Interface Status
      ios_command:
        commands:
          - show interface status

      register: interface_status_output

    - name: Assert Interface Status
      assert:
        that:
          - "'Interface' in interface_status_output.stdout"
        fail_msg: "Interface status not found."

    - name: Debug Interface Status
      debug:
        var: interface_status_output.stdout
```

In this playbook, we assume that you have a group of SDWAN routers specified in your inventory under the name `sdwan_devices`. Adjust this group name according to your inventory configuration.

The playbook executes the `show interface status` command on the SDWAN routers using the `ios_command` module. The output of the command is captured in the `interface_status_output` variable.

The `assert` module is used to check whether the string `'Interface'` is present in the output. If the string is not found, the assertion fails and an error message is displayed.

Finally, the playbook uses the `debug` module to print the interface status output (stdout) for further analysis or troubleshooting if needed.

You can save this playbook in a YAML file, such as `check_interface_status_test.yaml`, and execute it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```shell
ansible-playbook check_interface_status_test.yaml
```

Make sure to adjust the playbook parameters, such as the group name in the inventory, according to your specific SDWAN router configuration and commands.

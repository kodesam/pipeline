I apologize for any confusion, but it seems like the IP addresses for the master and worker nodes of your OpenShift cluster on bare metal have not been provided. To generate an Ansible playbook YAML file, I would need the specific IP addresses for the master and worker nodes in order to customize the configuration. Please provide the IP addresses so that I can assist you further.

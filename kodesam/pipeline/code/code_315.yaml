If you are looking to execute the `oc get nodes` command in your code, you can use the following Python code snippet:

```python
import subprocess

output = subprocess.run(['oc', 'get', 'nodes'], capture_output=True, text=True)
print(output.stdout)
```

This code uses the `subprocess.run()` function to execute the `oc get nodes` command as a subprocess. The `capture_output=True` parameter captures the output of the command, and the `text=True` parameter ensures that the output is returned as a string.

The output of the command will be printed to the console.

If you want to create a htpasswd users file in the temp directory, update identity providers, create AD, and add privileges to the AD users in OpenShift using Ansible, you can create a playbook with the following tasks:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure OpenShift Identity Providers
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Create htpasswd file
      shell: htpasswd -c /tmp/htpasswd {{ item.username }} -b {{ item.password }}
      with_items:
        - { username: "user1", password: "password1" }
        - { username: "user2", password: "password2" }
        - { username: "user3", password: "password3" }
      become: true
      become_user: root

    - name: Update OpenShift Identity Providers
      command: oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin {{ item }}
      with_items:
        - user1
        - user2
        - user3
      become: true
      become_user: root

    - name: Create Active Directory
      command: oc adm groups new ad_user_group
      become: true
      become_user: root

    - name: Add privileges to AD users
      command: oc adm groups add-users ad_user_group {{ item }}
      with_items:
        - user1
        - user2
        - user3
      become: true
      become_user: root
```

In this example, the `htpasswd` command is used to generate the htpasswd file in the `/tmp/htpasswd` path. Update the list of users and their passwords accordingly.

The playbook also includes tasks to update the OpenShift Identity Providers, create an Active Directory (substitute `ad_user_group` with your preferred group name), and add privileges to the AD users.

Save this playbook to a file (e.g., `openshift_playbook.yaml`) and execute the following command to run it:

```
ansible-playbook openshift_playbook.yaml
```

Please note that you may need to adjust the commands or tasks based on your specific OpenShift environment and requirements.

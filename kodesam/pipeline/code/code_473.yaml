To address the "PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit" alert in OpenShift, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) that triggers the alert. You can view the PDB objects in your cluster by running the command `oc get poddisruptionbudget`.

2. Determine why the PDB limit is being reached. The PDB specifies how many pods of a certain type can be disrupted (e.g., during maintenance or updates). Check if the PDB limit is too low or if there is a high number of disruptions occurring.

3. Adjust the PDB limit if necessary. You can update the PDB object to increase the maxUnavailable field, which determines the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable at a time.

4. Ensure that your workloads are properly spread across availability zones or nodes to avoid exceeding the PDB limit. If multiple pods of the same type are running on a single node and that node becomes unavailable, it can cause the PDB limit to be reached.

5. Monitor and analyze your cluster to detect any underlying issues causing frequent disruptions. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor cluster health and identify patterns or specific pods that are frequently disrupted.

6. Consider implementing a rolling update strategy for your deployments to minimize disruptions. Rolling updates allow pods to be updated gradually, reducing the impact on your application.

7. If necessary, consider adjusting your PDB settings or creating additional PDBs for different types of workloads to better manage disruptions.

By following these steps and regularly monitoring your cluster, you can effectively handle the "PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit" alert in OpenShift.

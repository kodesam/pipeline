Sure! Here's an example of an Ansible script that uses the `aws_az_info` module to gather information about availability zones in AWS, and then launches EC2 instances for the master and slave nodes. It also configures the master and slave nodes separately using roles, and deploys a WordPress and MySQL database connected to it on the respective slaves.

  hosts: localhost

# Define roles for configuring master and slave nodes, and deploying WordPress and MySQL


Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own AWS access key, secret key, region, security group, key pair, and other desired configuration settings.

Additionally, you'll need to define the roles for configuring the master and slave nodes, and deploying WordPress and MySQL. These roles can contain the necessary tasks and configurations specific to each component.

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example, and you may need to adapt and customize it according to your specific requirements.

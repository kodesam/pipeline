To install Python on multiple virtual machines, you can use a shell script to automate the process. Here's an example script that you can modify to fit your specific needs:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# List of virtual machine IPs or hostnames
vms=("192.168.1.101" "192.168.1.102" "192.168.1.103")

# Loop through each virtual machine and install Python
for vm in "${vms[@]}"; do
  echo "Installing Python on VM: $vm"

  # SSH into the virtual machine and run the commands
  ssh user@$vm << EOF
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y python3
    # Additional commands if needed
    # ...

    # Verify the Python installation
    python3 --version
    exit
EOF

  echo "Python installed on VM: $vm"
done
```

Make sure to replace the VM IP addresses or hostnames in the `vms` array with the ones you have. Also, adjust the SSH command to use the correct username and authentication method for accessing the virtual machines.

Save the script to a file (e.g., `install_python.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x install_python.sh`), and then run it by executing `./install_python.sh`. The script will iterate over each virtual machine, connect via SSH, and install Python on each of them.

Please note that this script assumes you are using a Debian-based distribution on your virtual machines. If you are using a different Linux distribution, you may need to adjust the package manager commands accordingly (e.g., `yum` for CentOS).

I hope this helps!

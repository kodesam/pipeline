```dockerfile

# Install Ansible and dependencies

# Copy Ansible configuration files

# Run Ansible playbook
CMD ["ansible-playbook", "playbook.yml"]
```

This Dockerfile creates a container based on the latest Ubuntu image and installs Ansible and its dependencies. It also copies the `ansible.cfg` configuration file to the default location and sets up the working directory to `/ansible`. The `playbook.yml` file is also copied to the container. Finally, the container runs the Ansible playbook specified in the `CMD` command.

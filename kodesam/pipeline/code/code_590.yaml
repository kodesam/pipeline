Sure! Here's an example of a YAML script in Jinja format:

```jinja
{% set name = "John" %}
{% set age = 25 %}
{% set city = "New York" %}

person:
  name: {{ name }}
  age: {{ age }}
  city: {{ city }}
```

In this example, we have defined three variables (`name`, `age`, and `city`) using the `set` statement. These variables are then used within the YAML structure to generate the desired output.

The resulting YAML output would be:

```yaml
person:
  name: John
  age: 25
  city: New York
```

You can modify the values of the variables as per your requirements.

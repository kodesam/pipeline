Certainly! Here's an example of a task for provisioning VMs in OpenShift in an Ansible playbook:

```yaml
- name: Provision VMs in OpenShift
  hosts: openshift_master
  tasks:
    - name: Create project
      kubevirt_project:
        name: myproject
        state: present

    - name: Create virtual machine instances
      kubevirt_vm:
        name: vm1
        api_version: kubevirt.io/v1alpha3
        kind: VirtualMachine
        namespace: myproject
        spec:
          running: true
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: myapp
              annotations:
                virtual.openshift.io/parent: myvmi
            spec:
              domain:
                resources:
                  requests:
                    memory: 2Gi
                    cpu: 2
              volumes:
                - name: myvolume
                  persistentVolumeClaim:
                    claimName: myclaim
                    readOnly: false
```

In this example, `openshift_master` is the target host or group of hosts where the OpenShift master is installed. The tasks use the `kubevirt_project` and `kubevirt_vm` modules to create a project (namespace) and provision virtual machine instances, respectively. Adjust the values of the `name`, `spec`, and other parameters based on your requirements.

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as the `kubectl` command-line tool and the `kubevirt` extension, and that the Ansible control machine has the appropriate permissions to interact with the OpenShift cluster.

Note: This example assumes that you have already set up OpenShift and have the required namespaces, persistent volume claims, and other resources in place. Adjust the task to your specific OpenShift environment.

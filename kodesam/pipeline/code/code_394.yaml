Sure! Here's an example of a YAML script that defines a route in a web application:

```yaml
routes:
  - path: /home
    controller: HomeController
    action: index
    method: GET

  - path: /users
    controller: UserController
    action: list
    method: GET

  - path: /users/{id}
    controller: UserController
    action: show
    method: GET

  - path: /users
    controller: UserController
    action: create
    method: POST

  - path: /users/{id}
    controller: UserController
    action: update
    method: PUT

  - path: /users/{id}
    controller: UserController
    action: delete
    method: DELETE
```

In this example, we have defined several routes for a web application. Each route has a `path` that specifies the URL pattern, a `controller` that indicates the controller class responsible for handling the request, an `action` that specifies the method within the controller to be executed, and a `method` that indicates the HTTP method for the route.

You can add more routes to this YAML script by following the same structure.

Certainly! Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that creates a GitOps Operator Project, OperatorGroups, and Subscription in OpenShift:

```yaml
- name: Create GitOps Operator Project, OperatorGroups, and Subscription
  hosts: openshift_master
  tasks:
    - name: Create GitOps Operator Project
      openshift_project:
        name: gitops-operator-project
        state: present

    - name: Create OperatorGroup
      openshift_operator_group:
        name: gitops-operator-group
        namespace: gitops-operator-project
        state: present

    - name: Create Subscription
      openshift_operator_subscription:
        name: gitops-operator-subscription
        namespace: gitops-operator-project
        operator_group: gitops-operator-group
        source: community-operators
        source_namespace: openshift-marketplace
        source_labels:
          - olm.catalogSource=community-operators
        state: present
```

In this example, `openshift_master` is the target host or group of hosts where the OpenShift master is installed. The tasks use the `openshift_project`, `openshift_operator_group`, and `openshift_operator_subscription` modules to create the GitOps Operator Project, OperatorGroups, and Subscription, respectively. Adjust the values of the `name`, `namespace`, `operator_group`, `source`, `source_namespace`, and other parameters based on your requirements.

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as the `kubectl` command-line tool and the appropriate Ansible modules for interacting with OpenShift.

Note: This example assumes that you have already set up OpenShift and have the required Operator Catalog and OperatorSources in place. Adjust the task to your specific OpenShift environment.

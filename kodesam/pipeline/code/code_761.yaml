It seems like you want to import a module called `message` and use a `write` function from it to send a message to someone named John. 

Here's a basic code structure to achieve that:

```python
import message

# Call the write function from the message module
message.write(to="John", message="Hey, want to meetup after work?")
```

Make sure that you have the `message` module installed or available in your project directory.

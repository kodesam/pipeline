Certainly! Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that includes a loop to create application privileges in Kubernetes:

```yaml
- name: Create Application Privileges
  hosts: your_kubernetes_master
  tasks:
    - name: Create Application Privileges
      include_tasks: application_privileges.yaml
      loop:
        - app1
        - app2
```

In this example, `your_kubernetes_master` is the target host or group of hosts where your Kubernetes cluster is running. The `include_tasks` module is used to include the tasks defined in a separate YAML file called `application_privileges.yaml`. The loop is applied to iterate over the list of application names (`app1`, `app2`).

Inside the `application_privileges.yaml` file, you can define the specific tasks for creating application privileges based on the application name. For example:

```yaml
- name: Create Application Privileges for {{ item }}
  community.kubernetes.k8s:
    definition: "{{ lookup ('template', '{{ role_path }}/templates/{{ item }}') | from_yaml }}"
    state: present
    apply: yes
```

In this example, the `{{ item }}` variable is used to reference the current iteration value from the loop.

Make sure you have Ansible installed and the necessary modules available. Adjust the playbook and task files to match your specific application privileges setup and template files.

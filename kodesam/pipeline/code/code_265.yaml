If you want to gather vSphere platform details in an OpenShift cluster using Ansible, you can create a playbook with the following tasks:

```yaml
---
- name: Gather vSphere Platform Details
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
    - name: Gather vSphere Platform Facts
      community.vmware.vmware_vm_facts:
        hostname: "{{ vcenter_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ vcenter_username }}"
        password: "{{ vcenter_password }}"
        validate_certs: false
      register: vsphere_facts

    - name: Debug vSphere Platform Details
      debug:
        var: vsphere_facts
```

In the above playbook, replace `{{ vcenter_hostname }}`, `{{ vcenter_username }}`, and `{{ vcenter_password }}` with the appropriate values for your vSphere environment. The `community.vmware.vmware_vm_facts` module is used to gather vSphere platform facts.

Save this playbook to a file (e.g., `gather_vsphere_details.yaml`) and execute the playbook using the following command:

```
ansible-playbook gather_vsphere_details.yaml
```

This playbook will gather vSphere platform details for the specified vCenter server and display the gathered facts using the `debug` module.

Note: You will need the `community.vmware.vmware_vm_facts` module installed to run this playbook. You can install it by running `ansible-galaxy collection install community.vmware`.

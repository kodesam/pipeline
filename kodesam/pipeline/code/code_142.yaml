Here is an example of an Ansible playbook that includes tasks to deploy an OpenShift worker node, gather cluster ID, provision virtual machines, provision bare metal, and provision VMs:

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy OpenShift Worker Node
  hosts: worker_nodes
  tasks:
    - name: Task 1 - Gather Cluster ID
      # Define the task to gather the cluster ID
      # ...
    - name: Task 2 - Provision Virtual Machines
      # Define the task to provision virtual machines
      # ...
    - name: Task 3 - Provision Bare Metal
      # Define the task to provision bare metal
      # ...
    - name: Task 4 - Provision VMs
      # Define the task to provision VMs
      # ...
```

In this example, `worker_nodes` is the target group of hosts where you want to deploy OpenShift worker nodes. Each task is defined using the `name` parameter and is followed by the specific task definition. You can replace the comments (`# Define the task...`) with the actual task details.

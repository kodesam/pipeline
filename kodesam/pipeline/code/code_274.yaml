Here is an example of an Ansible playbook that uses the `shell` module to run the commands and verify the password complexity:


---
- name: Verify password complexity
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check minlen value
      shell: grep ^minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf
      register: minlen_output
      changed_when: false

    - name: Check credit values
      shell: grep -E "^\s*\Scredit\s*=" /etc/security/pwquality.conf
      register: credit_output
      changed_when: false

    - name: Print minlen output
      debug:
        var: minlen_output.stdout_lines

    - name: Print credit output
      debug:
        var: credit_output.stdout_lines


You can save this script in a file, for example `password_complexity.yml`, and run it with the `ansible-playbook` command:


ansible-playbook -i inventory_file password_complexity.yml


Make sure to replace `inventory_file` with the path to your Ansible inventory file containing the hosts on which you want to run the commands.

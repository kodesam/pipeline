To add the MCP_Check part to the playbook, you can use the `when` conditional statement to conditionally execute tasks based on a specific condition. Here's an updated version of the playbook:

```yaml
- name: Register Machine Config Pool
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Get Machine Config Pools
      k8s_info:
        kind: MachineConfigPool
      register: mcps

- name: Include MCP
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Include MCP Task File
      include_tasks: mcp.yml
      loop: "{{ mcps.resources }}"
      loop_control:
        loop_var: mcp
      no_log: true

- name: Sleep for 30 seconds to ensure MCP is refreshing
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Pause for 30 seconds
      pause:
        seconds: 30
      when: not pauseMCP

- name: MCP Check
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Perform MCP Check
      # Add your tasks here
      # These tasks will be executed after the MCP has been included and the pause is finished
      when: not pauseMCP
```

In the above playbook, the `MCP Check` section has been added as a separate play. This play is triggered only when the `pauseMCP` variable is False because of the `when` conditional statement.

Inside the `MCP Check` play, you can include the necessary tasks that need to be performed after the MCP has been included and the pause is finished. You can add your own tasks between the `- name: Perform MCP Check` and `when: not pauseMCP` lines.

Ensure that the `MCP Check` play is placed at the desired position in your playbook to execute the tasks accordingly.

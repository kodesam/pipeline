Certainly! Here's an example of a basic Dockerfile:

```
# Use the official Python base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the required packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the remaining files to the working directory
COPY . .

# Set the command to run the application
CMD [ "python", "app.py" ]
```

Make sure to replace `app.py` with your actual main Python file, and place any additional files or directories you need to include in the COPY command.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

To deploy a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal, you can use a combination of tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and kubeadm. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Set up your infrastructure using Terraform: 
- Create a new directory for your Terraform code.
- Write a Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`) to define your infrastructure, including the number of nodes, network settings, and any other necessary resources. Here's an example configuration:

```
provider "metal" {
  token = "<your_project_token>"
}

resource "metal_device" "k8s_nodes" {
  count      = 3
  hostname   = "k8s-node-${count.index}"
  image      = "ubuntu-20.04"
  plan       = "t1.small.x86"
  facilities = ["<your_facility>"]
  project_id = "<your_project_id>"
}
```

2. Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:
- Run `terraform init` in your directory to initialize Terraform.
- Run `terraform apply` to create your infrastructure based on the configuration.

3. Configure the nodes using Ansible:
- Create an Ansible playbook or role to configure the nodes with the necessary dependencies and settings for Kubernetes. Here's an example playbook:

```
- name: Configure Kubernetes nodes
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Docker
      apt:
        name: docker.io
        state: present

    - name: Disable swap
      command: swapoff -a
      when: ansible_swaptotal_mb > 0

    - name: Set kernel parameters
      sysctl:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        value: "{{ item.value }}"
        sysctl_set: yes
        state: present
      with_items:
        - { name: "net.ipv4.ip_forward", value: "1" }
        - { name: "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables", value: "1" }
        - { name: "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables", value: "1" }

    - name: Install Kubernetes packages
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        name: "{{ packages }}"
        state: present
      vars:
        packages:
          - kubelet
          - kubeadm
          - kubectl

    - name: Enable kubelet service
      systemd:
        name: kubelet
        enabled: yes
        masked: no

    - name: Start kubelet service
      service:
        name: kubelet
        state: started
```

4. Run the Ansible playbook or role to configure the nodes:
- Ensure that your Ansible inventory lists the IP addresses or hostnames of your bare metal nodes.
- Run `ansible-playbook <playbook_name>.yml` to configure the nodes with Kubernetes dependencies.

5. Initialize and join the cluster using kubeadm:
- SSH into one of the nodes that will act as the control plane.
- Run `kubeadm init` to initialize a new Kubernetes cluster.
- Follow the instructions provided by kubeadm to set up the control plane and join the worker nodes to the cluster.

After following these steps, you should have a Kubernetes cluster up and running on your bare metal nodes. You can then use tools like kubectl or Helm to manage and deploy your applications in the cluster.

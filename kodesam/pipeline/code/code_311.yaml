If you want to revoke an access token in an OpenShift cluster using Ansible, you can create a playbook with the following tasks:

```yaml
---
- name: Revoke Access Token
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Revoke Access Token
      command: oc revoke token {{ access_token }}
      become: true
      become_user: root
```

In the above playbook, replace `{{ access_token }}` with the actual access token you want to revoke.

Save this playbook to a file (e.g., `revoke_access_token.yaml`) and execute the following command to run it:

```
ansible-playbook revoke_access_token.yaml
```

Make sure to execute this playbook on a host that has the necessary permissions to revoke the access token in the OpenShift cluster. You may need to adjust the `become_user` value and other parameters based on your specific environment.

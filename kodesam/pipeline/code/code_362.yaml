Certainly! Here's an example of a Dockerfile for creating a container for ArgoCD:

```Dockerfile
FROM argoproj/argocd:v2.1.0

# Add any additional customizations or configuration here

# Expose the web UI and API server ports
EXPOSE 8080 8081

# Set the entrypoint
CMD ["argocd-server"]
```

In this Dockerfile, we start with the base image `argoproj/argocd:v2.1.0` which contains the ArgoCD server. You can add any additional customizations or configuration specific to your needs.

We expose ports `8080` and `8081` to allow access to the ArgoCD web UI and API server respectively.

Finally, we set the `CMD` to `argocd-server` to start the ArgoCD server when the container launches.

You can build this Dockerfile using the `docker build` command and run the resulting image using `docker run`.

If you want to execute the `oc get nodes` command in your code, you can use the following Python snippet:

```python
import subprocess

def get_nodes():
    try:
        output = subprocess.check_output(['oc', 'get', 'nodes'])
        print(output.decode('utf-8'))
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

get_nodes()
```

This code uses the `subprocess.check_output()` function to execute the `oc get nodes` command and retrieve the output. It then decodes the output from bytes to a string and prints it. If the command fails, it catches the `CalledProcessError` exception and prints an error message.

Make sure you have the `oc` command installed and accessible in your environment to use this code.

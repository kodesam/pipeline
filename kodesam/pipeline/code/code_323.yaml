```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install Ansible and SSH
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y ansible ssh

# Set up working directory
WORKDIR /ansible

# Copy Ansible playbooks
COPY playbook.yml .

# Run Ansible playbook
CMD ["ansible-playbook", "playbook.yml"]
```

This Dockerfile sets up an Ubuntu-based container with Ansible and SSH installed. It then copies your Ansible playbook file (`playbook.yml`) into the container's working directory. Finally, it runs the Ansible playbook when the container is started.

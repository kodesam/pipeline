To register the names of files in a variable in a programming language like Python, you can use the following code:

```python
file_names = []  # Create an empty list to store file names

# File name registration
file_names.append("file1.txt")
file_names.append("file2.txt")
file_names.append("file3.txt")

# Accessing the file names later
for file_name in file_names:
    print(file_name)  # Or do any other operations with the file names
```

In the code snippet above, we create an empty list `file_names` to store the names of the files. Then, we use the `append()` method to add file names to the list. Later, you can access the file names by iterating over the list elements or performing any other operations as needed.

The file names listed above ("file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt") are just examples; you can replace them with the actual file names you want to register.

To add a host or group to the inventory in Ansible using the `add_host` module, you can utilize the following script:


- name: Add a host to inventory
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Add Openheimer movie host
      add_host:
        name: openheimer-movie
        groups: movie-group
        ansible_host: openheimer-movie.example.com
        ansible_user: movie_user
        ansible_password: movie_pass
        ansible_port: 22

- name: Download Openheimer movie
  hosts: movie-group
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Download movie
      command: echo "https://example.com/openheimer-movie.mp4"
      register: movie_link

    - name: Display movie link
      debug:
        var: movie_link.stdout


Explanation:
- In the first play, we add a host named `openheimer-movie` to the `movie-group` group using the `add_host` module. We specify the necessary connection details like `ansible_host`, `ansible_user`, `ansible_password`, and `ansible_port`.
- In the second play, we target the `movie-group` group to download the Openheimer movie. In this example, we are simply echoing a dummy movie link for demonstration purposes.
- Finally, the movie link is displayed using the `debug` module.

Make sure to replace `openheimer-movie.example.com` with the actual hostname or IP address of the movie host, `movie_user` and `movie_pass` with the appropriate credentials, and `"https://example.com/openheimer-movie.mp4"` with the actual download link for the movie.

You can save the script in an Ansible playbook file, let's say `add_movie.yml`, and execute it using the `ansible-playbook` command: 


ansible-playbook add_movie.yml


Note: The `movie-group` must already be defined in your inventory file or dynamically added using other methods.

Certainly! Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that creates application privileges in Kubernetes:

```yaml
- name: Create Application Privileges
  hosts: your_kubernetes_master
  tasks:
    - name: Create Application Privileges
      community.kubernetes.k8s:
        definition: "{{ lookup ('template', '{{ role_path }}/templates/{{ item }}')| from_yaml }}"
        state: present
        apply: yes
```

In this example, `your_kubernetes_master` is the target host or group of hosts where your Kubernetes cluster is running. The tasks use the `community.kubernetes.k8s` module to create application privileges in Kubernetes based on a template. Adjust the values of `role_path` and `templates/{{ item }}` to point to the correct template files.

Make sure you have Ansible installed and the `community.kubernetes.k8s` module available.

Note: This example assumes that you have defined the necessary application privileges in the template files. Adjust the task to match your specific application privileges setup.

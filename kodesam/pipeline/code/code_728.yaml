Creating a deployment to perform health checks of various components in an OpenShift cluster requires a combination of Kubernetes YAML manifests and custom scripts. Below is an example of creating a deployment to check the health of pods, deployments, routes, API response, operator status, cluster version, and web console status.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: health-check-deployment
  labels:
    app: health-check
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: health-check
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: health-check
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: health-check-container
        image: health-check-image:latest
        command:
        - /bin/bash
        - -c
        - |
          # Execute custom health check script here
          # Check pod health
          if ! kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase!=Running; then
            echo "Pod health check failed"
            exit 1
          fi

          # Check deployment health
          if ! kubectl get deployments --field-selector=status.replicas!=status.availableReplicas; then
            echo "Deployment health check failed"
            exit 1
          fi

          # Check route health
          if ! kubectl get routes --field-selector=status.ingress!=[]; then
            echo "Route health check failed"
            exit 1
          fi

          # Check API response
          if ! curl -s http://api-server:8080/healthz; then
            echo "API health check failed"
            exit 1
          fi

          # Check operator status
          if ! oc get operatorhub -n openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager --no-headers | grep -i running; then
            echo "Operator status check failed"
            exit 1
          fi

          # Check cluster version
          if ! oc get clusterversion; then
            echo "Cluster version check failed"
            exit 1
          fi

          # Check web console status
          if ! oc get oauthclient -n openshift-authentication --no-headers | grep -i oauth-openshift; then
            echo "Web console status check failed"
            exit 1
          fi

        # Update resources and environment variables as per your requirements
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "1Gi"
          requests:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512Mi"
```

In this YAML manifest, a deployment named `health-check-deployment` with one replica is created. The deployment runs a container named `health-check-container` that executes a custom health check script. The script checks the health of pods, deployments, routes, API response, operator status, cluster version, and web console status using appropriate `kubectl` and `oc` commands.

Replace the image name `health-check-image:latest` with the actual image name and tag corresponding to your custom health check script.

To deploy this health check deployment, save the YAML manifest into a file (e.g., `health-check-deployment.yaml`) and apply it to your OpenShift cluster

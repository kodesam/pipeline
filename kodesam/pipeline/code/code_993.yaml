Sure! Here's an example of how you can add a route to a YAML script:

```yaml
routes:
  - path: /example
    method: GET
    handler: exampleHandler
```

In the above code, we define a route with the path "/example", the HTTP method "GET", and the handler "exampleHandler". You can replace "exampleHandler" with the actual name of your handler function.

Make sure to add this code within the appropriate section of your YAML script, depending on the framework or tool you are using.
